Sorting Algorithms

Bubble sort - compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong
order

Insertion sort - pushes input down until the node below it is not less than it

Selection sort - divides the input list into two parts

Quick sort - picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the
picked pivot
